        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Unfortunately, I was not able to keep any of the work I did at my previous company over the last 10 years. Since I haven't been on the market, I haven't prepared many public projects in Github. I am currently working on a few projects that I will
            be able to share soon. I have worked on a few projects that I will not be able to share, but I will be able to discuss in some general detail.

                <p>Although a simple web app to host my about me page, resume, contact info, and portfolio (soon), this application uses several technologies and concepts to get to this point. I just started this project last week and will be continuing
                    to update it as I can get free time. I plan to add the Continous Integration with some test cases, add more portfolio projects, and create the IaC with Terraform for this application and others. <br><br>Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/jdmorrisett/flask-me">Github</a>                    for the latest info.</p>
